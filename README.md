#### Abstract
Recent experiments indicate that the C-Jun Amino-Terminal Kinase-Interacting Protein 1 (JIP1) binds to and activates the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) protein. JNK is an integral part of cell apoptosis, and misregulation of this process is a causative factor in diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), obesity and cancer. It has also been shown that JIP1 may increase the phosphorylation of tau by facilitating the interaction between the tau protein and JNK, which could also be a causative factor in AD. Very little is known about the structure and dynamics of JIP1; however, the amino acid composition of the first 350 residues suggests that it contains an intrinsically disordered region. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using AMBER 14 were used to study the structure and dynamics of a functionally active 10mer JIP1 fragment, to better understand the solution behavior of the fragment, and to compare it to the JNK-bound structure. 2 μs of unbiased MD was performed on the JIP1 10mer fragment in 10 different seeds; and from this, 7 structurally stable conformations of the 10mer fragment were identified via classical clustering. The 10mer ensemble was also used to build a Markov state model that identified four metastable states that encompassed 5 of the 7 conformational families identified by classical dimensional reduction.
